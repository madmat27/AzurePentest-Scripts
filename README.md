# AzurePentest-Scripts

This is part of the code which is submitted with my thesis "Security in Cloud System".
(Aristotle University of Thessaloniki - MSc in Communication Networks and Systems Security - Issue date: 2023)

## What's in this repo?
In this paper, penetration testing scenarios are described in Azure Platform and this git repository 
contains the powershell scripts that create the resources required for each scenario to work.
Within each folder, there is also the respective "cleanup.ps1" script which deallocates and deletes the section's 
resources, in order to maintain the lab environment clean and available for custom actions.

## Can I use it?
This repository is free for anyone to use and is based on "PacktPublishing - Penetration-Testing-Azure-for-Ethical-Hackers".

All corrections and amendments are more than welcome!
